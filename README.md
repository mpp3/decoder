Move around inside a computer's memory, looking to bytes through the glasses of a variable.

## Who is this for?

Anyone interested in understanding the relationship between variables and bytes (bits and values) through types.

But, mostly, for computer science teachers, who want their students to /visualize/ the concepts of variable, type, and value.

If you teach computer science, use this small tool to support your introductory explanations of those topics.

## How to use it?

Click to create a variable of the desired type. 
Move the variable over the memory, and see how it /interprets/ the bits beneath. 
Drop the variable on a specific address of memory.
Hover to see the bits behind the value.
Clic the particles to get random bytes in memory.
Double click a byte to edit its bits.
Double click a variable to edit its value (and the bits beneath).
